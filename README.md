# Theremini Specials
• User friendly pitch assist correction with selectable scales and root note, so you can't play a wrong note! You can also turn this off for classical theremin glissando sounds, or just dial it back for partial correction as you improve your technique.
• 32 different sounds on-board, covering a range of basses, lead sounds, classical theremin tones and much more.
• Adjustable stereo ping-pong delay built right in, for wonderful ethereal sounds right out of the box!
• Built in tuner gives live visual feedback of currently playing note, showing how close you are to hitting the note to help learn pitch and scales.
• Built in speaker for instant playback anywhere.
• Headphone output (which mutes the speaker) for practising!
• Stereo 1/4" audio outputs to connect Theremini to audio interfaces, looping pedals, stereo systems, multitrack recorders or anything you like!
• Single Pitch CV output w/ selectable range, so you can connect it to analogue synthesizers and use the Theremini as a wild CV modulation source.
• 21 user selectable scales and user-adjustable root note selection (including chromatic)
• User selectable note range: choose the highest note and lowest note (stored per preset), so it can be set up as you prefer
